    submenu for chat options misaligned
        slightly

want:
    find way to soft refresh messages / character name in sidebar for below and bot name changes
    toggle for (text) being hidden
        in API menu, thats important enough
    toggle greentext / quote behavior in system
    make save indicator not jump around the place
        maybe replace connection indicator in main_chat?
        maybe pin to bottom?

maybe:
    expand 'description' in character by default?


big maybe:
    export / import just for prompt files
    second /third prompt previews in character and prompt submenu

for the love of god:
    optimize those custom prompt stuff in main.js to use a loop instead of borderlands tier amounts of click/change handlers
