        toggles ugly as sin
        submenu for chat options ugly

want:
    improve soft refresh messages
        buggy and replaces user avatar
    toggle for (text) being hidden
        in API menu, thats important enough
    toggle greentext / quote behavior in system
    make save indicator not jump around the place
        maybe replace connection indicator in main_chat?
        maybe pin to bottom?

maybe:
    expand 'description' in character by default?
    second /third prompt previews in character and prompt submenu


big maybe:
    export / import just for prompt files

for the love of god:
    optimize those custom prompt stuff in main.js to use a loop instead of borderlands tier amounts of click/change handlers

fixed:
